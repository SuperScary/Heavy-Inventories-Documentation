# Machine Learning

Heavy Inventories operates entirely on dynamically generated data, ensuring that no item weights are hard-coded. 
Instead, the mod utilizes a sophisticated machine learning algorithm to calculate the most accurate and plausible weight 
for each item. This advanced algorithm considers a wide range of factors, including:

1. **Material Composition**: The algorithm analyzes the materials that make up each item, taking into account the density 
and weight of these materials in real-world scenarios.
2. **Item Size**: The physical dimensions of an item are factored into the weight calculation. Larger items naturally weigh 
more than smaller ones made of the same material.
3. **In-Game Usage**: How an item is used in the game can influence its weight. For example, a pickaxe is designed to be 
more robust and, therefore, heavier.

The machine learning model behind Heavy Inventories is trained on a vast dataset of item attributes and their 
corresponding weights. It continually learns and adapts by processing new data, allowing it to adjust the weights of 
existing items and accommodate new items introduced through game updates or other mods. This dynamic approach ensures 
that the weight values are balanced, realistic, and reflective of the in-game environment.

By employing machine learning, Heavy Inventories eliminates the need for manual adjustments and hard-coded values. The 
algorithm's ability to generate accurate weights on-the-fly means that players experience a consistent and immersive 
gameplay mechanic, where the weight of items affects movement, combat, and inventory management in a realistic manner. 
This system not only enhances the challenge but also adds a layer of strategic depth, as players must consider the weight 
of items when planning their activities and adventures.
