# Setup
The Heavy Inventories setup process is just like any other mod. Simply place the mod in your ./mods directory and launch 
your game. 

```admonish warning
Heavy Inventories only supports NeoForge 21.0.0+
```

Optionally, you can create a weights folder in the root of your installation and pre-populate it with weight files should
you choose to do so.
